                    as spring embarked we began to work on this site
                    some days we became full of ourselves some days we regretted doing that.
                    there was hardships, there was farewells, there was pain
                    and there was nights we kept working with blood coming out of our eyes to keep em from drying out. but we kept pushing ourselves
                    till now, reminding our selves the sweetness of accomplishing something. now that this product is finnished we thanks all those who helped
                    us in accomplishing this trial may humanity blooms in all of us. glory to mankind <b>yorha unit Battle android 2A</b>
